# Crowd Story

A web app for creating a story with random people across the internet.  Built with [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/).  Live at [story.patsobo.com](http://story.patsobo.com).

# How does it work?

Every week, anyone from the internet can post to a new story.  At the end of the weeklong period, the story gets moved to the archives.  The story maxes out at 20,000 characters.
